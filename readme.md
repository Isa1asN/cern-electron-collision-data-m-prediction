# CERN Electron Collision Data
## Particle collision events with two electrons- Invariate electron mass prediction using artificial neural networks 
## About Dataset
This dataset contains 100k dielectron events in the invariant mass range 2-110 GeV for use in outreach and education. These data were selected for use in education and outreach and contain a subset of the total event information.
## Content
* Run: The run number of the event
* Event: The event number.
* E1, E2: The total energy of the electron (GeV) for electrons 1 and 2.
* px1,py1,pz1,px2,py2,pz2: The components of the momemtum of the electron 1 and 2 (GeV).
* pt1, pt2: The transverse momentum of the electron 1 and 2 (GeV).
* eta1, eta2: The pseudorapidity of the electron 1 and 2.
* phi1, phi2: The phi angle of the electron 1 and 2 (rad).
* Q1, Q2: The charge of the electron 1 and 2.
* M: The invariant mass of two electrons (GeV).
